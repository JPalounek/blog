**Real quick today. I want to show you a new icon for TotalFinder. I want to roll it into the next release.**

TotalFinder is growing slowly from hacker-style geek guy into a very nice and friendly Mac citizen. I think it's the time to put off the shades! I believe the new icon reflects it perfectly. Again credit goes for <a href="http://raist.cz">Raist</a> who has created it. Thanks!

#### How do you like it?

#### Also modified blog part of the site

I've got some complains about the font readability on the site. I didn't have much time to play with the web site again, but I disabled BitLow font at some places. Hope it helps a bit.
