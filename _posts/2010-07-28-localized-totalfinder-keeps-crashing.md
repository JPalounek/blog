**My mom always told me: "write automated tests, my boy"<br>But you know... I had always better things to do.**

#### After expiration TotalFinder wants to say something...

But my localization function crashes for some reason in Russian, Japanese and Chinese versions. And maybe in others too! I would guess translators didn't use localization string placeholders correctly or something on my side.

#### The rescue: Please upgrade to TotalFinder 0.9.6 manually
