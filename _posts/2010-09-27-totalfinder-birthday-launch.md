** Today is it one year since I started hacking on TotalFinder. And today it is the first day when you may buy a license if you want to support the next years of development. **

#### Yeah, TotalFinder has the Mojo

Not everything is perfect of course, but... just hit it!

#### Thank you all

I want to thank you all who have supported my work and helped with the project. 

People were asking for discounts for beta testers. But I think $15 is already a great price. Later with more features TotalFinder will probably climb to $20 price-point. So you may look at $15 as an introductory price.

I will give away $1000 worth of licenses in a few hours. I will do a small lottery and pick from people who sent crash reports. Also all translators and people who helped a lot may expect a happy email soon. I have all you guys on my list of free-give-away-licenses. Stay tuned!

#### New documentation

There is a new <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com">documentation section</a> on the site which should answer your questions about new release and licensing options.

And please report any troubles and annoyances with the site, payment system and such. You know, I'm doing a commercial launch for the first time and as you can imagine my last few days were pretty busy.
