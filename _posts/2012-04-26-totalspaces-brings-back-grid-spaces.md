** I'm excited to announce a new product from BinaryAge. TotalSpaces is a productivity tool for Mac. You guess right, it taps into the system and improves Spaces experience. **

TotalSpaces provides several handy features for heavy Spaces users. In a way it brings back the old grid-based Spaces behavior we loved in Snow Leopard. It offers custom transitions when switching Spaces. For example featuring the famous Cube transition. And of course you may customize hotkeys, hotcorners and the way how circulation through the grid works. Sounds good? Look into [the documentation](http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/documentation) to get more info on individual features in the current version.

#### Meet Stephen from Helsinki

TotalSpaces has been developed by **[Stephen Sykes](https://twitter.com/sdsykes)** - a Mac developer, hacker and radio electronics guru. He is a computer veteran, an englishman living in Finland. TotalSpaces is his idea to improve his daily window management tasks. He is really quick at switchin Spaces! You may read more about Stephen on [his homepage](http://www.stephensykes.com).

#### The story behind TotalSpaces

TotalSpaces was originally called **ReSpaceApp** and was presented by Stephen's [Switchstep Company](http://switchstep.com). He has released several free beta versions during past few months and got a warm feedback from passionate Mac users. He has contacted me back in March to get some help on marketing side and to share some know-how. I liked his work and invited him to San Francisco. We had a good time there and decided to cooperate. We decided to release ReSpaceApp with a new name under BinaryAge. TotalSpaces and TotalFinder should be close together.

Hope you will give it a shot!

<div style="font-size: 8pt; color: #666">You don't have to be worried about the future of TotalFinder. I still focus primarily on TotalFinder development. Stephen will work exclusively on TotalSpaces. And together we will share user support burden and technicalities of running online business. This should earn us both more time for real development.</div>
