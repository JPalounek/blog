I've just released TotalFinder 0.8.1. I don't have any new exciting features for you today. This is a pure bugfix release.

This is a list of crashes I got during last 48 hours. I'm happy to announce I have just squashed [@askForNewFileBrowser], [@NumberOfDualTabs] and [@TabStripController dealloc].

Thank you all who care about TotalFinder and sending me crash reports. 

Enjoy a bit more stable TotalFinder!
