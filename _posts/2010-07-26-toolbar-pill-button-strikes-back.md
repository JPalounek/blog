#### Toolbar Pill Button

Toolbar Pill Button was one of the top <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/toolbar_pill_button_missing">requested features</a>. It wasn't that easy to implement as it looks, but I've finally cracked it down. I had to disable original animations, because they looked really jerky. I've also improved the way how is Finder's sidebar and toolbar managed under TotalFinder's reign.

#### Translators did a nice job, thank you guys!

I'm really glad you guys picked up my [instructions](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n) and contributed your changes directly to `totalfinder-i18n` repo on GitHub. I know it was something new to learn on your side. But please understand this is a great time-saver for me. Much appreciated.

TotalFinder got translated into Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Spanish and Chinese. And here is the [list of contributors](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/contributors). The project is evolving, you are always welcome to fork and make your own contribution. Thank you.

It has been almost month since the last version and I had so many plans for this release. Unfortunately I got toasted in my day-job and I had almost no extra time and energy to push TotalFinder much further. This is quite frustrating, but take it from the other side: you may enjoy another free month :-)

As TotalFinder grows on popularity I'm also spending quite a lot of time on support. Not only at [GetSatisfaction forums](http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage), but also replying individual emails. At this place I'd like to thank [Lorenzo Orlandi](http://getsatisfaction.com/people/kiwidesign) who is doing great job answering questions on public forums. He took a lot work out of my plate so I can focus more on development. Thank you, Lorenzo!

Approaching 1.0 and launching the product commercially is maybe the most difficult phase so far. I'm always looking for new motivation. 
And I've found a real gem. The podcast for people like me who are trying to launch their own web site or product. Check out [Startups for the rest of us](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com) by Mike and Rob. Those guys are doing a great job by explaining important stuff and sharing their own experiences. 

I have joined their [Micropreneur Academy](http://www.micropreneur.com) and I hope this will enable me to launch sooner and avoid some obvious mistakes.
